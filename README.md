## Overview
The exercise is from the course - Learn React for free created by Bob Ziroll from [Scriba](https://scrimba.com/).

### What I learned
In this exercise, I learned how to use `Array.maps()` to loop through the data array and pass each data in the component as `props` to render them on the page.
